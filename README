Welcome to reliable_udp.

reliable_udp is free software. Please see the file COPYING for details.
For documentation, please see the files in the doc subdirectory.
For building and installation instructions please see the INSTALL file.

Compile Note:
./reconf
./configure
make

Usage:
Test in 127.0.0.1 Network
./client -f FileNameYouWantToSave
start another console
./server -f FileNameYouWantToSend

Test in real network:

first start client
./client -f FileNameYouWantToSave -p PortNumber -a NetworkIPAddressForClient

then client will wait on NetworkIPAddressForClient:PortNumber 

Start server
./server -f FileNameYouWantToSend -p PortNumber -a NetworkIPAddressForClient -s ServerNetworkIPAddress
The NetworkIPAddressForClient:PortNumber will receive packet from sever

Test Drop Packet:
add -o possibilty_of_packet_lost

./client -f FileNameYouWantToSave -o 2 
this command drops 5 out of 100 packets

Test Delay:
add -l possibilty -t delaytime
  
./client -f FileNameYouWantToSave -l 2 -t 2000
this command delay 2% packets 2000 microseconds. 

Known Limitation:

Client can not accept random sequence number packets. So if random sequence number, Client just simplely drops all packets after that. This will cause Server retransmite 
all packets after the lost packet. This design limitation is the reason why sometime transfer stop in the middle of file.

If packets drop rate over 10% or delay over 100000 microseconds, it is very easy to stop in the middle of transfer.
